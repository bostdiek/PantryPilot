"""Domain models for AI extraction orchestration (Phase 2 additions).

This module introduces two explicit, typed contract objects used by the
`Orchestrator` implementation and API layer:

* DraftOutcome  - Result of a nonâ€‘streaming extraction attempt (authoritative
  return type; no tuple fallback maintained).
* SSEEvent      - Structured Server Sent Event payload used by the streaming
  extraction flow. The orchestrator now emits structured events which are
  serialized to the SSE wire format in a single place to keep schema uniform.

Having these models makes downstream reasoning, testing, and refactoring easier
and prevents ad hoc dict construction from drifting over time.
