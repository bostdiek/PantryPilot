# ADR-001: Security Headers and CORS Configuration Baseline

## Status

**Accepted** - Implementation completed

## Context

PantryPilot is designed for small private deployments (families, small groups) but needs a solid security foundation that can scale. The application faces several security challenges:

1. **CORS Configuration**: Without proper CORS configuration, the React frontend cannot securely communicate with the FastAPI backend
2. **Web Security Headers**: Modern browsers expect baseline security headers to prevent common attacks
3. **HTTPS Readiness**: Small deployments often start with HTTP but need a clear path to HTTPS
4. **Attack Surface**: Web applications are vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and BREACH attacks
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Users deploy on various platforms (Raspberry Pi, cloud, self-hosted) with different security needs

### Security Requirements Identified

- Strict CORS origin validation with credential support
- Modern security headers following current best practices
- BREACH attack mitigation for sensitive API endpoints
- HTTPS deployment documentation and tooling
- Backward compatibility with existing deployments

## Decision

We will implement a **baseline security configuration** that provides essential protections for small private deployments while supporting growth to production scale.

### Architecture Decisions Made

#### 1. CORS Configuration Strategy
- **Strict Origin Validation**: No wildcard origins (`*`) when credentials are enabled
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Support CSV and JSON formats for flexible deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all CORS scenarios including preflight requests

#### 2. Security Headers Implementation
- **Nginx-Level Headers**: Implement security headers at the reverse proxy level for all responses
- **Modern CSP Approach**: Use `frame-ancestors` directive instead of deprecated `X-Frame-Options`
- **Conditional HSTS**: Ready for HTTPS but commented until enabled
- **API-Specific Security**: Additional protection for sensitive endpoints

#### 3. BREACH Attack Mitigation
- **Selective Compression**: Disable gzip for API endpoints containing sensitive data
- **Cache Control**: Proper cache headers to prevent sensitive data caching
- **Content-Type Protection**: Strict MIME type enforcement

#### 4. HTTPS Deployment Strategy
- **Multi-Platform Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for various deployment scenarios
- **Management Tooling**: Scripts and templates for easy HTTPS setup/management
- **Certificate Options**: Support for Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, and self-managed certificates

### Implementation Approach

#### Minimal, Surgical Changes
- Enhance existing configurations rather than replacing them
- Maintain backward compatibility with clear upgrade paths
- Add comprehensive testing without modifying working code
- Provide extensive documentation and management utilities

#### Configuration Files Modified
```
.env.example                           # Enhanced CORS documentation with security warnings
README.md                             # Added security features section  
nginx/nginx.conf                      # Baseline security headers for all responses
nginx/conf.d/default.conf            # API-specific security measures and BREACH mitigation
```
