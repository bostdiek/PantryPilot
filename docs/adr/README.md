# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for PantryPilot.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

We follow a simple format for ADRs:

- **Status**: What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [001](./ADR-001-security-headers-and-cors-baseline.md) | Security Headers and CORS Configuration Baseline | Accepted |

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions, please document them by creating a new ADR following the established format and updating this index.
