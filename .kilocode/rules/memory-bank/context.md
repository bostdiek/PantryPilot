# Context

## Current work focus
**COMPLETED: AI Extraction Complexity Reduction Phase 1.1** - Successfully implemented comprehensive test fixtures and TestModel approach, dramatically reducing test complexity and establishing foundation for remaining refactoring phases.

## Recent changes
- **COMPLETED: AI Extraction Test Simplification (October 2025)**
  - Reduced test file from 1,081 to 884 lines (18% reduction) using fixture-based approach
  - Created comprehensive [`tests/fixtures/ai_fixtures.py`](apps/backend/tests/fixtures/ai_fixtures.py) with 1,096 lines of well-organized fixtures
  - Implemented TestModel class for intelligent Pydantic model data generation with type safety
  - Eliminated 20+ complex mock patterns, replaced with clean, reusable fixtures
  - Established solid foundation for remaining AI extraction refactoring phases
  - Updated plan: [AI_EXTRACTION_COMPLEXITY_REDUCTION_PLAN.md](AI_EXTRACTION_COMPLEXITY_REDUCTION_PLAN.md)
- Updated tech documentation with precise Make targets and behaviors based on the Makefile:
  - Environment/Compose flows, migrations, installation, code quality, testing, convenience, database ops, and cleanup commands
  - Added quick usage examples and tool notes
  - File: [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md)
- Created architecture summary capturing runtime topology and critical flows:
  - Env overlays: base + dev/prod compose files; .env.dev/.env.prod
  - Startup flow: docker compose up -d; DB readiness via pg_isready; Alembic migrations via uv run
  - DB lifecycle and preservation strategy, DB scripts, CI/quality flows, developer setup
  - File: [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md)
- Created ADR for signed deep links in AI drafts and intents, defining schemas, endpoints, flows, and patterns: [docs/adr/2025-09-11-deep-links-for-ai-drafts.md](docs/adr/2025-09-11-deep-links-for-ai-drafts.md)
- **COMPLETED: Mobile UI/UX Research** - Comprehensive analysis of touch interactions, modal accessibility, responsive design, and React hooks for mobile meal planning app experience

## Next steps
- **AI Extraction Refactoring Phase 1.2**: Complete test architecture improvements
  - Further reduce test file to target <500 lines (need additional 384 line reduction)
  - Implement dependency injection patterns to remove remaining complex mocking
  - Create service interfaces/protocols for clean testability
- **AI Extraction Refactoring Phase 2**: Consolidate duplicate logic
  - Remove production code that exists only for testing (functions like `_choose_run_extraction_agent`)
  - Create unified draft service to centralize draft operations
  - Standardize error handling patterns across endpoints
- Keep README, Makefile, and Memory Bank aligned; consider cross-linking key tasks in README to Memory Bank sections
- Validate presence of referenced scripts and adjust docs if needed:
  - [db/backup.sh](db/backup.sh), [db/restore.sh](db/restore.sh), [db/maintenance.sh](db/maintenance.sh), [scripts/check_migrations.sh](scripts/check_migrations.sh)
- Optionally document repeatable maintenance workflows in tasks:
  - Examples: reset-db-volume, clean-deps, clean-keep-db as task entries in [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md)
- Implement AI drafts feature per ADR: new model/endpoints, frontend param handling (suggest switch to Code mode)
- **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: Mobile UX improvements based on research findings
